This is a hedge maze photographed from above by photographer Ben Mathis Siebel. I chose this image because although this maze almost certainly looks complicated to people walking through it, from the photographer's perspective, it's actually very simple.
I hope that all of the complicated-looking things that we are learning in this course will turn out to be equally simple once I'm looking at them the right way.
